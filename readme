CSS - Grid.
Final project of Intermediate css part - the Odin Project Fullstack JS.

In this particullar project, I was given screenshot of admin Dashboard.
Main goal was to style this page focusing on css Grid, not flexbox.
It was new to me, but grid is logical and I got the hang of it in no time.
Still need more practice, but this was nice exercise to try it on.
